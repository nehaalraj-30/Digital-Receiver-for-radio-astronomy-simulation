window_main is the comparison a full precision fft of hann window with various windows described with n-bit lengths
main_adc is passing a sine input into and adc and taking fft and it comparison with a full precision sine wave and plotting its errors
main contains the process of taking an adc input -> windowing it and taking fft (window is n bit precise as this is a simulution for what wil be implemented on a red pitaya)
